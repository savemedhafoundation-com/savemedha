# Work Log – Kidney/Cancer/Heart pages (Today)

- Added reusable `NaturalImmunotherapyButton` component with branded green gradient and default icon, and wired it into cancer, kidney, heart, nerve, SMA, other treatment pages plus TreatmentDetail CTA.
- Expanded kidney detail data with `KIDNEY_NIT_CAUSES` for all kidney conditions to drive condition-specific NIT insight sections and FAQs on `KidneyLearnMore.jsx`.
- Refined Kidney learn-more page: fixed navigation key typo, added NIT video section/accordion powered by per-condition causes, enabled FAQs for all kidney conditions, and ensured “Natural Immunotherapy” text highlights (#5b1e13) in section titles.
- Set NIT video to autoplay, adjusted stripe offset styling, and cleaned duplicate/typo blocks in Kidney learn-more layout.
- Synced symptom rendering to new image folders (e.g., Alport, MCD) and aligned Minimal Change Disease/Alport Syndrome content updates.
